## Stakeholder Questions

**Who are you as a studio / company?**

    We are FuryFistStudios, initially I was a solo developer, but I have recently moved to working with a team under the name FuryFistStudios. We are looking to release games under our studio, and would like to use your skills to create a simplified version of an idea we may expand on in the future.

**What is the goal behind this game?**

    To make something interesting and fun to play. Doesn't need to be new ideas, just a game that is genuinely enjoyable to play is enough for us.

**What is your inspiration for this game, what other studios and games have you drawn ideas from?**

    Cyberpunk as a style, not in reference to the game, is a style I always find myself coming back to. The whole neon city idea is pretty cool. It would be interesting if the game drew reference from platformers like celeste, but included the combat and rougelite aspects of games like enter the gungeon or the binding of isaac.

**What genre/s do you want the game to be?**

    Dungeon crawler, rougelite, platformer

**Where and when is the game set?**

    Probably in the distant future, seeing as the cyberpunk theme is going to be prevelent

**What mechanics do you want the game to contain?**

    Maybe an item system like that of the binding of isaac, where different items change how the game is played. Incorporating that with the platformer aspect would be an interesting idea.

**How much support do you want the game to have, i.e. controller support?**

    Controller support is not a necessity, but would be nice. 

**How accessible do you want the game, i.e MacOS, Linux, and Mobile support?**

    Just a windows game works as of now, no branching out is required.

**What sort of people is the game going to be directed to?**

    Probably the people interested in the games I mentioned above.

**Do you require any external intergrations, i.e highscores leaderboard stored online?**

    Not as of now, possibly in the future

**Is there a specific time the game needs to be fully finished and ready to be released?**

    Not presently. As of now I just want to see what you can come up with, so take your time

**Are there are restraints, mandates, guidelines, or TOSs for the game?**

    Shouldn't be, just don't use copyrighted content obviously 

**Why will people want to return to the game?**

    As I said above, a game that is fun to play and is an enjoyable experience. A game like that would keep bringing people back

**Will the game be picked back up when opening or is it a one time run sort of playstyle?**

    Drawing inspiration from gungeon and TBOI, a run system would be good, where each time you get sent through the same levels, but have different rooms and encounter each time you go through. 

**Is there a storyline that the game will follow?**

    Not one specifically as of now, if you want to start putting on together then by all means

**Where do you want the game to be released, i.e itch.io, steam?**

    Itch for now, steam would be good later down the line.

**Do you want the game to be well optimized to increase support of less powerful machines?**

    Yes, that would be good. Maybe a setting menu to allow users to customize the game to fit their specifications
